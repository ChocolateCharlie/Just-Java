# Just-Java

## master branch

This is my *Just Java* app, issued from the following Udacity's course : ***Android Basics : User Input***

Making an App Interactive - Lesson 1 and 2

Object-Oriented Programming Part 2

NB : The app doesn't support Spanish like in the course, but French.

### coffee-machine branch

This is a fake coffee machine app using for baseline code my *Just Java* app (*before the OOP course*). It does nothing usefull, but it was a good exercise.
