# Just-Java

This is a fake coffee machine. It does nothing usefull, but it was a good exercise.

The base code was my *Just Java* app, issued from the following Udacity's course : ***Android Basics : User Input***.

## Functionnalities

- choose a drink by pressing on a *drink* button
- adjust the number of sugar teaspoons by pressing on the **-** and **+** buttons (there cannot be more than 5 teaspoons)
- submit your order by pressing the *order* button : a message recapitulating the order should appear below this button

Prices are fictionnal.
